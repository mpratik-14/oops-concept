Polymorphism is the method in an object-oriented programming language that performs 
different things as per the object's class, which calls it. With Polymorphism, a message is sent to multiple class objects, 
and every object responds appropriately according to the properties of the class



#python code
#Eg 1--> 

#code
def test(a, b):
    return a + b
 
print(test(5,6))
print(test("dkode ", "kumar"))
print(test([3,4,5,6,7,8], [4,5,6,7,89]))

#output
'''   11
dkode kumar
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 4, 5, 6, 7, 89]        '''



#Eg 2-->

#code
class ineuron:
    def msg(self):
        print("this is msg  to ineuron ")
        
    
class xyz:
    def msg(self):
        print("this is a msg to xyz")

def test(notes):
    notes.msg()
i = ineuron()
x = xyz()
